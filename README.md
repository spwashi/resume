## About this

These days, I keep my resume as an SVG built from the ground up.
SVG is a graphically-powerful, document-based markup language,
which makes it a great option for representing creative intent.

This way, I can send people a link, and if they need to copy and paste all the text,
I can rest assured knowing it's well-structured.

Building it by hand helps me remain aware of which thoughts or ideas
of mine feel easy to express or give life. I like to keep this in mind
as I explore other mediums and the materials they encourage.

## The Old Resume

As I've been applying to jobs, 
I noticed there were a few ways my 
most recently-previous resume had been parsed 
into various forms or textboxes.

The inconsistency was because of the format (I always saved it as a PDF)
and the way it was made (prioritizing aesthetics over accessibility).

Adobe InDesign gave me a lot of power at my fingertips making PDFs,
and I still appreciate elements of my previous resume's design,
but it was just too cumbersome trying to arrange and layer the text
such that it could be consistently interpreted by an unpredictable system.

Adobe Illustrator allowed me to export SVGs,
but I ran into a similar difficulty making the layers 
consistently meaningful. 

The layer and class names were 
generated, which helped with unique reference, but didn't facilitate 
change operationalization. 

The generated code was very bloated,
and used inefficient but consistent methods for achieving layout.

## The New Resume

Now, the resume I use is a lot easier to intentionally change.

I've gotten more fluent using SVG constructs, and I feel confident that I can copy and 
paste the substance behind my resume into most forms without jumbling the meaning.

I'm excited to dive deeper into SVG animation, especially for the sake of 
learning how we relate to media now that the AI revolution 
is picking up speed.

# !! It's Interactive !!

- There are links you can **click**, 
- **copy the text** and **paste it** into an editor to see a secret message :)
