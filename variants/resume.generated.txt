Professional Experience
10 years

I've spent a fair bit of time exploring language. Especially wondering how language can be utilized to: 1) construct symbolic landmarks, 2) identify facets of ambiguity, and 3) develop cohesive visualizations to interact with those structures.

Professionally, I've had variety:
small teams with new codebases, mid-sized teams with mature codebases; codebases inherited through company mergers, codebases maintained through high turnover;

scripted backends with compiled frontends, compiled backends with CDN-hosted JavaScript; developing managers who were very hands-off, non-developing managers who were very hands-on; ^ (and I've learned from each to practice different ways to reduce ambiguity)

The first thing I do when I start a job is learn the language. I learn what the goals are, how those goals been pursued in the past, and how the current direction of the team relates to that aim. Then, I practice using that language. Every team is unique, and I find that it's easy to make assumptions that any particular concept is universally understood.

Meaningful Experience
Hello!
My name is Sam Washington!
and am samwashington
and I'm really good* at learning.

I majored in Learning and Education Studies after two years in the Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum because I wanted to understand enough theory to build momentum for a student organization I'd founded. The student org was called Student Body for Meaningful Education (SBME), and it was focused on facilitating spaces for Discussing, Creating, and Connecting students to a sense of mutually profound meaning. Education means different things to different people, and that made SBME an interesting challenge to tackle.

While I was pursuing Electrical Engineering, I got a chance to assist with research in the nanofabrication lab under Dr. Lynford Goddard. In that lab, the experiment I helped with was related to photoelectrochemical etching on silicon wafers â€” essentially using rays of light in certain chemical solutions to make shapes like transistors. I definitely miss the Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum because those math classes and their pure science / engineering counterparts gave me a lot of really interesting and useful metaphors for interpreting things in my daily life. Especially Differential Equations, which helps me visualize highly dynamic systems by relating to their constituent parts. That math class in particular taught me the implications of exponential growth , which combined with my values towards accessible stability, made it clear that Learning and Education Studies would be the most broadly useful major.

By that point, I had already worked with two companies as a software developer, and knew I was self-motivated enough to learn on my own. I loved being in the College of Education because you could tell the faculty genuinely cared about fostering their students' relationships to the material. There, I got a chance to assist with research in The Adult Learning Lab under Dr. Elizabeth A L Stine-Morrow, with an experiment examining the effects of periodic brain-training on cognitive function (compared to reading or doing nothing for the same amount of time). Dr. Stine-Morrow taught a class, Learning from Text, that introduced me to the philosophy and cognitive science that now underpins a language I've been developing called Spw.
