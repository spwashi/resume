I've spent a fair bit of time exploring language.
Especially wondering how language can be utilized to:
1) construct symbolic landmarks,
2) identify facets of ambiguity, and
3) develop cohesive visualizations to interact with those structures.
Professionally,
I've had variety:
small teams with new codebases,
mid-sized teams with mature codebases;
codebases inherited through company mergers,
codebases maintained through high turnover;
scripted backends with compiled frontends,
compiled backends with CDN-hosted JavaScript;
developing managers with very hands-off approaches,
non-developing managers with very hands-on approaches;
^ (and I've learned from each
to practice different ways
of reducing ambiguity)
The first thing I do when I start a job is learn the language.
what the goals are,
how those goals been pursued in the past,
and how the current direction of the team relates to that aim.
Then, I practice using that language.
Every team is unique,
and I find that it's easy to make assumptions
that any particular concept is universally understood.
